  <h1>Positioning Example</h1>

  <div>
    <h2>Static</h2>
    <h3>
      "Static is the default position for HTML elements. Elements with position: static are positioned based on the
      normal flow of the page, as you would expect them to be without any CSS styling. They are not affected by the top,
      right, bottom, or left properties. Z-index also does not apply to static elements."
    </h3>
    <div id="div-1">1</div>
    <div id="div-2">2</div>
    <div id="div-3">3</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Relative</h2>
    <h3>
      "When assigned position: relative, an element follows the render flow of the page, but will be shifted relative to
      its initial position.To determine the amount of offset, you set values for the top, right, bottom, and/or left
      properties. Surrounding elements won’t be affected, but there will be space where the repositioned element would
      have been (in static positioning)."
      <div id="div-4">1</div>
      <div id="div-5">2</div>
      <div id="div-6">3</div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Fixed</h2>
    <h3>
      "Elements with position: fixed do not adhere to the normal render flow of the document. Instead, fixed elements
      are positioned relative to the viewport — in other words, the part of the document that is currently visible in
      the browser.Fixed elements do not move when the user scrolls, and, unlike relative, they do not leave a blank
      space where the element would have been positioned. You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to set
      the fixed element's final position."

    </h3>
    <div id="div-7">7</div>
    <div id="div-8">8</div>
    <div id="div-9"></div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Absolute</h2>
    <h3>
      "With position: absolute, an element ignores the normal document flow. However, instead of being positioned
      relative to the viewport (like with position: fixed), it’s positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
      (a positioned ancestor is any element with a position value besides static, the default)."

    </h3>
    <div id="div-10">1</div>
    <div id=container>
      <div id="div-11">2</div>
    </div>
    <div id="div-12">3</div>
  </div>

  <div class="sticky-container">
    <h2>Sticky</h2>
    <h3>
      "Elements with position: sticky are positioned depending on the user’s scroll. Depending on how far the user has
      scrolled down the page, a sticky element behaves like a relative element until the viewport meets a specified
      position. Then it becomes fixed in a spot and appears to “stick” to the page as the user scrolls.In this example,
      scroll down and watch as div 2 goes from behaving like a relative element to a fixed element when it reaches the
      position top: 0 and “sticks” to the top of the viewport."
